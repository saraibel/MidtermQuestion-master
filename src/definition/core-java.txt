Explain the entire java life cycle.

what is class?
-> A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
What is object?
--> An object is an instance of a class.
What is the entry point of an application?
--> Entry Point is a point of failure that might enable a vicious intentional person to break the application and cause damage.
Why main is static?
-->  because keyword static allows main to be called without creating an object of the class in which the main method is defined.
Which class is the superclass of all classes?--> The Object class

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
--> Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.
Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path.


What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
-->Main difference is methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ? --> No.

what is Access Specifier? --> It specifies the accessibility or scope of a field, method, constructor, or class.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
-->OOP concepts let us create working methods and variables, then re-use all or part of them without compromising security.
encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
--> A java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages.
java. lang package.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
-->  Application Programming Interface.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
-->No.
 Java doesn't allow multiple inheritance to avoid the ambiguity caused by it.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
-->  is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name,
if their argument lists are different. It is similar to constructor overloading in Java,
that allows a class to have more than one constructor having different argument lists.


Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
-->An exception (or exceptional event) is a problem that arises during the execution of a program.
When an Exception occurs the normal flow of the program is disrupted and the program/Application terminates abnormally,
which is not recommended, therefore, these exceptions are to be handled.


What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
-->It indicates that the particular member belongs to a type itself, rather than to an instance of that type.
 By adding the static keyword before the variable during declaration.


What is final, finally and finalize?
--> A final class cannot be instantiated, a final method cannot be overridden and a final variable cannot be reassigned.
 A final class cannot be instantiated, a final method cannot be overridden and a final variable cannot be reassigned.
 Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.


What is a constructor ?
-->When a class or struct is created, its constructor is called. Constructors have the same name as the class or struct,
 and they usually initialize the data members of the new object.



Can we have multiple constructors in a class? --> Yes.


If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
-->
What is "this" keyword in java ?
-->Refers to the current object in a method or constructor.


What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
-->  Refers to superclass objects. It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.
can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable, to invoke immediate parent class method ,
to invoke immediate parent class constructor.


What is JVM stand for ? --> Java Virtual Machine
Is JVM platform independent? --> No


What version of java are you using? --> 14.0.1.0


What is JAR stand for ? --> Java ARchive


What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
--> JDK is a software development kit whereas JVM is an environment for executing bytecode.


What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
--> If JRE is the container, JVM is the content.


What is compile time and run time?
-->Compile-time is the time at which the source code is converted into an executable code .
Run time is the time at which the executable code is started running.


What is heap? -->The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.

How java manage it's memory?
-->Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs.
When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected.
During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.


What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
--> The String class is an immutable class whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes are mutable.
StringBuffer is synchronized i.e. thread safe. It means two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously.
StringBuilder is non-synchronized i.e. not thread safe.


What is Singleton class?
-->A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance.


What is Serialization and Deserialization?
--> Serialization means to convert an object into that string.
Deserialization is its inverse operation.


when to use transient variable in java?
- transient is a variables modifier used in serialization. At the time of serialization,
if we donâ€™t want to save value of a particular variable in a file, then we use transient keyword.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
- While loop executes the code block only if the condition is True.
- Do While loop, condition is tested at the end of the loop so Do While executes
the statements in the code block at least once even if the condition Fails.

What is Enum?
- Enum is a special Java type used to define collections of constants.

What is Iterator?
- Iterators are used in Collection framework in Java to retrieve elements one by one. There are three iterators.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
- they are the same, they represent a same value.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
- Once string object is created its data, it can not be changed.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
- is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
- Serial Collector is mostly designed for single-threaded environments.
- Parallel Garbage Collector is used for multi-threaded environments.

What is JIT stands for?
- Just In Time compilation.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
- The garbage collector is a program which runs on the Java Virtual Machine which gets rid of objects
  which are not being used by a Java application anymore.
- The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
- No

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
- The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory is used to store local variables and function call
  while heap memory is used to store objects in Java.
- If there is no memory left in the stack for storing function call or local variable,
JVM will throw java.lang.StackOverFlowError, while if there is no more heap space for creating an object,
JVM will throw java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java Heap Space.
- stack memory is a lot lesser than the size of  heap memory in Java.
- Variables stored in stacks are only visible to the owner Thread while objects created in the heap are visible to all thread.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
- Reflection in Java is the ability to examine and/or modify the properties or behavior of an object at run-time.

what is multithreading in java?
- Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution
  of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
- Synchronization is the process of allowing threads to execute one after another.

What is Framework?
- Frameworks are large bodies (usually many classes) of pre_written code to which
  you add your own code to solve a problem in a specific domain.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
- JUNIT, REST Assured, Selenium, TestNG, Mockito, Spock Framework, Cucumber, SpringTest, DBUnit, Robot Framework.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
- TestNG is quite similar to JUnit, but with added functionalities and features such as parallel test execution,
  parameterization, and more. It is inspired by JUnit and NUnit.

What are the dependencies for this project?
-Sometimes, you may need to invoke methods in a test case in a particular order,

what is dependency injection in java?
- In software engineering, dependency injection is a technique whereby one object
  (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
- static binding in Java occurs during compile time while dynamic binding occurs during runtime.
  private , final and static methods and variables use static binding and are bonded by compiler
  while virtual methods are bonded during runtime based upon runtime object.
